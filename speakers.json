      "bio": "BoJack Horseman is a self-loathing 52-year-old alcoholic horse whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called Horsin' Around in the late 1980s          and later 'The Bojack Horseman Show' which was cancelled after one season, in 2007.\n\nThough he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and        jaded towards Hollywood and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often        result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him.\n\nMany of his issues stem from his childhood and issues with his unhappy parents, which the audience is shown        through flashbacks.",
