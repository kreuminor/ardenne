    The merged Ardenne Preparatory and Extension High School came into existence on September 1, 2000. Prior to this date Ardenne Preparatory School and Ardenne Extension High School were two separate entities managed by the same Board of Governors. Both institutions shared the same physical space with the Preparatory School in session form 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. daily, and the Extension High School from 12:30 to 5:05 p.m. Neither school satisfied the Ministry of Educationâ€™s requirement for contact hours i.e. the number of hours the teachers meet with students on any given day. This put the schools at a disadvantage when compared with similar schools. In order to address this situation, streamline administrative functions and expand the co-curricular programme the merger of both institutions became necessary.

  <P>
   <font size="2.9em">
    We accept that if we internalize the following values so that they become habits, they will empower us to create a wide variety of practices to deal with different situations. These values must therefore guide our conduct thus enabling us to realize our vision and achieve our goals.

    <p>All children are a gift from God and are our most valued resources. All children have the capacity to learn and the potential for growth. Every person has inherent integrity and worth. Integrity and honesty form the basis of trust which is essential for cooperation and collaboration. A school of quality values, protects and supports children. Diversity presents opportunities and challenges in an interdependent world. Equitable, quality education for all our children.</p>

   <font size="2.9em">
    We envision that students will develop an awareness and acceptance of God as creator, and Jesus Christ as Saviour that Ardenne Preparatory and Extension High School will become an institution that defines quality Christian education. a school of excellence, which will produce students who are not only literate and numerate, but who have a strong work ethic, good analytical, problem-solving, decision making, social, and information communication technology skills. graduates who will become citizens of integrity and thus be able to make a worthwhile contribution to nation building. graduates who will develop a love for knowledge, realising that learning is a life long process, and so take responsibility for their own learning.
