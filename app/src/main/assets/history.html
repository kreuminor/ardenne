    The merged Ardenne Preparatory and Extension High School came into existence on September 1, 2000. Prior to this date Ardenne Preparatory School and Ardenne Extension High School were two separate entities managed by the same Board of Governors. Both institutions shared the same physical space with the Preparatory School in session form 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. daily, and the Extension High School from 12:30 to 5:05 p.m. Neither school satisfied the Ministry of Educationâ€™s requirement for contact hours i.e. the number of hours the teachers meet with students on any given day. This put the schools at a disadvantage when compared with similar schools. In order to address this situation, streamline administrative functions and expand the co-curricular programme the merger of both institutions became necessary.
